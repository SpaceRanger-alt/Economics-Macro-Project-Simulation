# Economics-Macro-Project-Simulation


This repository contains GROUP  economic model simulator and a set of visualization tools to analyse the model's output. The project aims to provide insights into complex economic dynamics by simulating interactions between various economic factors and presenting the results through animated visualizations.
Key Features

Advanced economic model implementation using differential equations
Simulation of multiple economic factors including households, firms, government, central bank, unemployment, inflation, and environmental impact
Efficient simulation using NumPy and SciPy
Performance optimization with Numba
Separate visualization programs for different aspects of the economic model
